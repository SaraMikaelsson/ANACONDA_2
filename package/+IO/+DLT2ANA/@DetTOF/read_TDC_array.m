% DEPRECATED: This version is used by DLT.read_slow, which is much slower than DLT.read.
%
% Interpret triggings of the TDC (time-to-digigal) converter, within a group,
% into device-independent TOF, X, Y coordinates (or only TOF).
%
% The raw words from the TDC-card (DLT-file) can be reconstructed
% as (2^24*(chanels-1) + value_unsigned).
% where value_unsigned = value if value >= 0, or value + 2^24 otherwise.
%
% Note: DLT.read optimizes away the call to this method if the detector's
% public list of channels (.channels_onebased) is empty. If any special
% detector subclass should be called also for empty events it needs to have
% an empty channels_onebased (and handle possible channel-filtering
% using another internal property).
%
% A detector that needs access to the full event data, including all channels,
% should use an empty channel list (.channels_onebased).
%
% PARAMETERS
%  channels  (uint32) T-by-1 array with the one-based channel index of each trigging.
%            The conversion from zero-based index in the DLT file format
%            to one-based index is done to fit the convention in Matlab.
%            Values from 1 to 253 are defined as valid channel
%            indices for the DLT file format while 253 and 255 are reserved for possible
%            future extensions (e.g. status/error codes or non-TDC data)
%            and 256 is not allowed (interferes with the group-start marker
%            used for a simple constraint that allows recovering a corrupted
%            file where data from head/middle is missing).
%            Example: triggings on the fifth channel have channel==5,
%            and the time-values in values(channel==5).
%
%  values    (int32) T-by-1 array with the time value of each trigging.
%            24 bits, in units of det.time_unit.
%
%  counts_selected  (double) C-by-1 array of the number of triggings for relevant channels.
%            If .channels_onebased is non-empty, only counts for those channels are returned.
%            Example: counts_selected(1) is for the fifth channel if .channels_onebased=[5].
%            If .channels_onebased is empty, counts for "all" channels
%            (as determined by dlt.hardware_info.number_of_channels) are returned.
%            Example: counts_selected(1) is for the first channel if .channels_onebased=[].
%            (A Matlab error occurs if the file contains triggings at larger than expected channel ids.)
%            NOTE: even when .channels_onebased is non-empty, channels and values contains
%            the unfiltered array of triggings (possibly also other channels).
% RETURN
%  XYT   (double) 1-by-hit_count, must match result from has_XY().
%            If an empty matrix is returned and discarded==0 then the empty event
%            is OK to use (has been rescued if rescued~=0).
%            If an empty matrix is returned and discarded~=0 then rescuing failed
%            (or the 'abort' mode of rescuing is used), so that the entire event
%            must be aborted (data on other detectors will not be used).
%
%  discarded (uint32) bitmask with the following meanings
%    1 'discarded_but_complete': discarded due to additional validity check,
%            e.g. DLD timing anomaly or (x,y)-radius.
%    2 'incomplete_group': different number of hits on DLD channels
%    If extensions to other bits are made, they should preferrably be consistent
%    with DLT.GROUP_STATUS_BIT (not that not all flags defined there may be returned by this function).
%
%  rescued   (uint32) bitmask with the same meanings as in discarded.
%    If rescued~=0 then the problems marked by the nonzero bits existed but
%    a re-analysis (dependent on rescue_mode) could produce a useable set of hits,
%    and at least one bit in discarded has been cleared.
%
%    If there were multiple problems, a rescue_mode algorithm can in principle
%    rescue a serious problem ('incomplete_group') while leaving a mild problem
%    e.g. hit outside allowed (x,y)-radius, thus returning discarded=1, rescued=2
%
%    The condition bitand(discarded, rescued) == 0 always holds.

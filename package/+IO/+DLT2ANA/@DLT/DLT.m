classdef DLT < handle
% Class representing a DLT file.
%
% DLT (Delay-Line Times) files are created by the CAT (Coincident Acquisition of Times)
% acquisition software, implemented in LabView.
%
% To read a DLT file into Matlab (e.g. for an ANACONDA2 analysis program),
% construct an instance of this class, adjust its configuration as needed,
% and finally call the read() method.
%
% The data structures (see below) holding the loaded event and hit data are
% called the "untreated" data layer, to distinguish them from an anticipated
% higher layer for "analysis".
% TODO: implement analysis layer methods and structures, with tools for conversion
% of X,Y,TOF data into physical coordinates such as momentum or kinetic energy.
% It is not decided whether that layer will be handled by the DLT class or elsewhere.
% 
% This is a handle class, i.e. instances are mutable and not copied on
% assignment. Multiple references may point to the same instance.
%
% DLT Methods:
%  DLT            - construct DLT instance for a file and reads the header.
%  read_foot      - read the file footer, with comment, counters and additional properties.
%  read           - load the file's data into memory.
%  get            - access the arbitrary properties that header and footer may contain.
%  get_hit_count  - simplified access to hit count, after file has been read.
%  (Run 'doc DLT' for a complete listing.)
%
% DLT Propeties:
%  discarded                   - tells whether a loaded event is OK to use, one row per detector.
%  rescued                     - tells discarded-status before event was rescued (if it was), one row per detector.
%  start_index                 - tells which indices in XYT belong to each event, one row per detector.
%  XYT                         - the untreated, loaded 3D (or 1D) hit data, one cell entry per detector.
%  absolute_group_trigger_time - timestamp for each event (if DLT.version >= 2).
%  readoption__keep_empty      - allow events with zero hits in the untreated layer?
%  readoption__keep_discarded  - allow discarded events in the untreated layer?
%  readoption__skip_contents   - to keep nothing but absolute_group_trigger_time in the untreated layer.
%  discarded_kept              - false if no discarded event was loaded.
%  (Run 'doc DLT' for a complete listing.)

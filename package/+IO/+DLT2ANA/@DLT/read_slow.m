% Old and slow way to read all groups from the DLT file
%
% The read() method populates the "untreated" data layer, where a hit
% consists of TOF [s], X [m] and Y [m].% 
% TOF-only detectors are also supported and may omit the X and Y rows
% of XYT or give NaN for them.
% NOTE: this is a difference from the LabVIEW CAT-program, where
% units of [ns] were used for all dimensions, thus leaving the T_X to X scaling
% to the higher layers, which seems incorrect since it is detector dependent.
%
% Whether empty groups (no hit on any channel) are kept in arrays is
% determined by the boolean .readoption__keep_empty field.
%
% PARAMETERS
%  continue_if_footer_is_missing (default: false)
%      If true, then an attempt to read is made even if the reading of
%      footer fails. The footer error message is printed but not returned.
%
% RETURN
%  event_count (double) number of groups read

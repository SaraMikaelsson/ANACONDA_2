% Reference implementation in Matlab of the original rescue algoritm ("skip spurious triggings / Rescue algorithm 0")
% by translation of the original implementation in lib_hits.llb/sub_RescueDiscardedEvent.vi.
%
% It is expected that minor modifications will be made in the version 1 ("skip spurious triggings / Rescue algorithm 1")
% to be implemented for the Matlab reader (Anaconda2), e.g. to have a limit for max_r [m] instead of max_t_r [ns] 
% and to change the cost function (increase the weight of TOF anomaly vs. radius).
%
% PARAMETERS
%  det       An instance of the DetDLD80 class, with the detector's parameters for min and max TOF anomaly.
%            (NOTE: this version 0 implementation does not use the max_r parameter.)
%
%  channels  (uint32) T-by-1 array with the one-based channel index of each trigging.
%            The conversion from zero-based index in the DLT file format
%            to one-based index is done to fit the convention in Matlab.
%            Values from 1 to 253 are defined as valid channel
%            indices for the DLT file format while 253 and 255 are reserved for possible
%            future extensions (e.g. status/error codes or non-TDC data)
%            and 256 is not allowed (interferes with the group-start marker
%            used for a simple constraint that allows recovering a corrupted
%            file where data from head/middle is missing).
%            Example: triggings on the fifth channel have channel==5,
%            and the time-values in values(channel==5).
%
%  values    (int32) T-by-1 array with the time value of each trigging.
%            24 bits, in units of det.time_unit.
%
% RETURNS
%  used_XYT      (double) 3-by-hit_count, must match result from has_XY().
%                The first row contains x-position [m]
%                and the second row contains y-position [m].
%                The last row, i.e. XYT(end,:), is always time-of-flight [s].
%  any_hit_in_rescued_group (boolean) = size(used_XYT,2) > 0

  % Outer loop: "Get a hit"
  % Each iteration succeds in extracting a valid hit (the "first" remaining hit, ordered by a depth + cost measure),
  % or terminates the rescuing.

  % To achieve a depth-first search in a simple way, an inner loop is used to traverse all index combinations in "numerical" order
  % but only the ones at the desired_depth are actually evaluated.
  % When the transversal at the current desired_depth is completed:
  %  a) if any index-combination at the desired_depth gave a valid hit, use the combination that gave a hit with the lowest cost-value and break the inner loop.
  %     The outer loop will then attempt to extract further hits using the triggings AFTER the ones already used.
  %     IMPROVEMENT NOTE: To not consider the previously skipped triggings BEFORE/BETWEEN the previously extracted hits is
  %     a non-essential restriction -- this algorithm will fail to find some "overlapping" hits at nearly identical TOF.
  %  b) if the maximum depth is reached: terminate the search
  %  c) otherwise, increase desired_depth and continue inner loop.

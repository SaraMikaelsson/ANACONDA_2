This is the Iterative code developed by FOM, Amsterdam. 
The executable does not require input arguments, but the executable directory does require a few files of certain names:

Input configuration filename: 		names.dat (ASCII file. First line).
First line:
unknown,itermode,itmax,radfac,angfac
	unknown, maybe to do with symmetry?
        itermode = 1: do itmax iterations
        itermode = 2: stop the iterations when the absolute sum difference
                between successive iterations stops decreasing
        itermode = 3: stop the iterations when the relative sum difference
                between successive iterations stops decreasing
                (the maximum no. of iterations is itmax)

        itmax = the highest number of iterations that the program can make
        radfac = correction factor radial iteration
        angfac = correction factor angular iteration

Second line:
filenumber, Sample_name
	filenumber: in most cases '1'.
	Sample_name: string value.
Third line:
x_size, y_size

Input data filename: 			images0001.dat (ASCII file, can be exported for instance from MATLAB by: save('/path/to/file/images0001.dat', 'variable', '-ascii').
Note that if the name is images0002.dat, the filenumber should be 2.
Output Abel inverted image: 		it_3dcart0001.dat (ASCII file, can be imported into MATLAB by: a = load('/path/to/file/it_3dcart0001.dat').

Additional information:
- filesize should be x_size*y_size (1000*1000 or 500*500)
- every iteration roughly takes below one minute CPU time (tested on a 2014 laptop)


Example:
in windows: run/click iterative_inversion.exe
in Linux/unix: run ./iterative_inversion_unix

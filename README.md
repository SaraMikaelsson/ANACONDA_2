For installation:
- copy the 'package' folder (included in the repository) to your local system.
- add this folder to the path (only the folder, not the subfolders), either by the command:
	addpath(fullfile('path','to','folder', ...., 'package'))
  or do this by right-clicking on the folder in the file browser in MATLAB, and click 'add to path'.


you are now ready to use all functions within the package. 

Use the GUI (under development) by writing 'GUI.main' in your command window.

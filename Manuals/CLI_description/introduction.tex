\section{Introduction}

This document presents the contents of the data analysis package `ANACONDA 2', or `ANACONDA', which allows the analysis of data recorded in experiments that use single-particle detectors (e.g. ions, electrons, photons ...), for example to study the correlation between these particles. These are often called `\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectron_photoion_coincidence_spectroscopy}{coincidence}' spectroscopic treatment methods.
This document presents three parts of the software. The structure of the event-based data, the structure of the metadata and finally the package containing all functions.

\subsection{general}
Functions of general use are stored in this category, that are outside of the standard package of MATLAB. These can be written for the package, and of use for all package categories. They can also originate from MATLAB File Exchange (\url{http://nl.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/}) 
The package has no parameters or constants stored, they are in general all provided by the metadata (see section 'metadata structure'). An exception is the general constants of nature, that are more or less written in stone. For example the unit conversion factors (converting eV to Joule). These constants are also stored in this category.

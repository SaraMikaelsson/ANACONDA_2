\section{Installation}


\paragraph{End user installation:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Download (or `clone') the file `ANACONDA.mltbx'
\item drag and drop the file into the matlab (command) window, and click install in the pop-up window.
\item A gettingstarted (example) file can be found in the '/doc/' directory.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Developer installation:}
\begin{itemize}
\item copy the 'package' folder (included in the repository) to your local system.
\item add this folder to the path (only the folder, not the subfolders), either by the command:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item addpath(fullfile('path','to','folder', ...., 'package'))
		\item or do this by right-clicking on the folder in the file browser in MATLAB, and click 'add to path'.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

you are now ready to use all functions within the package. 

Use the GUI (under development) by writing 'GUI.main' in your command window.

\section{Introduction}

This document shows how the data analysis package `ANACONDA 2', or `ANACONDA' can be installed and used, with the focus on new users. ANACONDA allows the analysis of data recorded in experiments that use single-particle detectors (e.g. ions, electrons, photons ...), for example to study the correlation between these particles. These are often called `\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectron_photoion_coincidence_spectroscopy}{coincidence}' spectrocopic treatment methods.

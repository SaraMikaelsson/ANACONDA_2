\section{Installation}

\paragraph{End user installation:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Download (or `clone') the file `ANACONDA.mltbx'
\item Drag and drop the file into the matlab (command) window, and click install in the pop-up window.
\item A gettingstarted (example) file can be found in the '/doc/' directory.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Developer installation:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Copy the 'package' folder (included in the repository) to your local system.
\item Add this folder to the path (only the folder, not the subfolders), either by the command:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item addpath(fullfile('path','to','folder', ...., 'package'))
		\item right-click on the folder in the file browser in MATLAB, and click 'add to path'.
	\end{itemize}
\item You are now ready to use all functions within the package. Note that the path might not be added automatically, every time you start up MATLAB. Click \href{https://se.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/startup.html}{here} for more help.
\end{itemize}

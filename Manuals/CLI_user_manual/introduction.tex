\section{Introduction}

This document shows how the data analysis package `ANACONDA 2', or `ANACONDA' can be installed and used, with the focus on new users that want to work with the command-line interface (CLI). ANACONDA allows the analysis of data recorded in experiments that use single-particle detectors (e.g. ions, electrons, photons ...), for example to study the correlation between these particles. These are often called `\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectron_photoion_coincidence_spectroscopy}{coincidence}' spectrocopic treatment methods. For more information of the content of the analysis package, the reader is referred to the CLI-description document.
